Install the SerialEcho.ino on your Arduino-compatible from the examples distributed with the Arduino Code7 library.
Make sure the Code7 python library is on your path, for example by setting the PYTHONPATH environment variable in your shell...
export PYTHONPATH=/home/cefn/Documents/blueshrimp/Code7/lib/python/

You should then be able to run...
python serialecho.py ttyUSB0
...changing the device name to match yours.
