These programs rely only on Serial and the SL4A python environment to set up simple data passing between an Android-compatible microcontroller circuit and an Android phone, using a paired JY-MCU bluetooth module running at 115200 baud.

For testing, install the corresponding .ino file on your Arduino, (with suitable hardware attached as necessary). Then upload the corresponding .html and .py to the /sdcard/sl4a/scripts/ directory 
on your Android device. 

The following will need to be installed on your Android for these scripts to work... 
SL4A http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/
...and...
Python For Android http://code.google.com/p/python-for-android/.

Some of the sketches may also need modules such as pyBluez to be installed or locally available to your script. 

It is feasible to package these scripts into an APK which satisfies all the above Android installation steps in one package.
