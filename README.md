==========

This repository contains some example scripts and code to support the use of Bluetooth serial with the Shrimp, in particular...
* The ShrimpFirmata sketch
* Python scripts demonstrating complex, layered communication over a (Bluetooth) serial link to a Shrimp running a modified Firmata sketch for remote control.
* Android-hosted scripts which connect from a phone (with "Scripting Layer for Android" and "Python for Android") and interact with a serially-connected ShrimpFirmata
* Utility scripts to auto-connect a paired Bluetooth device on Linux
